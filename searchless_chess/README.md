This repository provides an implementation of our paper [Grandmaster-Level Chess Without Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04494).

> The recent breakthrough successes in machine learning are mainly attributed to scale: namely large-scale attention-based architectures and datasets of unprecedented scale.
This paper investigates the impact of training at scale for chess.
Unlike traditional chess engines that rely on complex heuristics, explicit search, or a combination of both, we train a 270M parameter transformer model with supervised learning on a dataset of 10 million chess games.
We annotate each board in the dataset with action-values provided by the powerful Stockfish 16 engine, leading to roughly 15 billion data points.
Our largest model reaches a Lichess blitz Elo of 2895 against humans, and successfully solves a series of challenging chess puzzles, without any domain-specific tweaks or explicit search algorithms.
We also show that our model outperforms AlphaZero's policy and value networks (without MCTS) and GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct.
A systematic investigation of model and dataset size shows that strong chess performance only arises at sufficient scale.
To validate our results, we perform an extensive series of ablations of design choices and hyperparameters.

## Installation

Clone the source code into a local directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/searchless_chess.git
cd searchless_chess
```

This repository requires Python 3.10.
`pip install -r requirements.txt` will install all required dependencies.
This is best done inside a [conda environment](https://www.anaconda.com/).
To that end, install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads).
Then, create and activate the conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name searchless_chess python=3.10
conda activate searchless_chess
```

Install `pip` and use it to install all the dependencies:

```bash
conda install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have a GPU available (highly recommended for fast training), then you can install JAX with CUDA support.

```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```
Note that the jax version must correspond to the existing CUDA installation you wish to use (CUDA 12 in the example above).
Please see the [JAX documentation](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for more details.

### Installing Stockfish

Download and compile the latest version of Stockfish (for Unix-like systems):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish.git
cd Stockfish/src
make -j profile-build ARCH=x86-64-avx2
cd ../..
```


### Installing Leela Chess Zero

Follow the [Lc0 download instructions](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0?tab=readme-ov-file#downloading-source), i.e.,

```bash
git clone -b release/0.30 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0.git
```

Then build the engine as described in the [Lc0 build instructions](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0?tab=readme-ov-file#building-and-running-lc0).

We evaluate Lc0 with the largest-possible network from [Lc0's model catalogue](https://lczero.org/play/networks/bestnets/), i.e., the `Large` network.
To download that network, run the following command:

```bash
cd lc0/build/release
wget https://storage.lczero.org/files/768x15x24h-t82-swa-7464000.pb.gz
gzip -d 768x15x24h-t82-swa-7464000.pb.gz
cd ../../..
```

### Installing BayesElo

To compute the Elos for the different agents, we require [BayesElo](https://www.remi-coulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo/), which can be installed as follows:

```bash
wget https://www.remi-coulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo/bayeselo.tar.bz2
tar -xvjf bayeselo.tar.bz2
cd BayesElo
make bayeselo
cd ..
```


### Downloading the Datasets

To download our datasets to the correct locations, run the following command:

```bash
cd data
./download.sh
cd ..
```

We also provide the individual dataset download links in the following table
(the action-value dataset is sharded into 2148 files due to its size and only
the link to the first shard is listed below):

| Split | Action-Value | Behavioral Cloning | State-Value | Puzzles |
|------ | ------------ | ------------------ | ----------- | ------- |
| Train | [1.2 GB](https://storage.googleapis.com/searchless_chess/data/train/action_value-00000-of-02148_data.bag) (of 1.1 TB) | [34 GB](https://storage.googleapis.com/searchless_chess/data/train/behavioral_cloning_data.bag) | [36 GB](https://storage.googleapis.com/searchless_chess/data/train/state_value_data.bag) | - |
| Test  | [141 MB](https://storage.googleapis.com/searchless_chess/data/test/action_value_data.bag) | [4.1 MB](https://storage.googleapis.com/searchless_chess/data/test/behavioral_cloning_data.bag) | [4.4 MB](https://storage.googleapis.com/searchless_chess/data/test/state_value_data.bag) | [4.5 MB](https://storage.googleapis.com/searchless_chess/data/puzzles.csv) |


### Downloading the Model Checkpoints

To download the pretrained models to the correct locations, run the following command:

```bash
cd checkpoints
./download.sh
cd ..
```


## Usage

Before running any code, make sure to activate the conda environment and set the `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
conda activate searchless_chess
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/..
```

### Training

To train a model locally, run the following command:

```bash
cd src
python train.py
cd ..
```
The model checkpoints will be saved to `/checkpoints/local`.

### Puzzles

To evaluate a model's puzzle accuracy, run the following command:

```bash
cd src
python puzzles.py --num_puzzles 10 --agent=local
cd ..
```

`puzzles.py` supports the following agents:

* the locally trained model: `local`
* the pretrained models: `9M`, `136M`, and `270M`
* the Stockfish engines: `stockfish` and `stockfish_all_moves`
* the Lc0 engines: `leela_chess_zero_depth_1`, `leela_chess_zero_policy_net`, and `leela_chess_zero_400_sims`


### Tournament Elo

To compute the Elo for the different agents, run the tournament to play games between them and then compute the Elo for the PGN file generated by the tournament (more information on BayesElo can be found [here](https://www.remi-coulom.fr/Bayesian-Elo/)):

```bash
cd src
python tournament.py --num_games=200

cd ../BayesElo

./bayeselo
> ...
ResultSet>readpgn ../data/tournament.pgn
> N game(s) loaded, 0 game(s) with unknown result ignored.
ResultSet>elo
ResultSet-EloRating>mm
> 00:00:00,00
ResultSet-EloRating>exactdist
> 00:00:00,00
ResultSet-EloRating>ratings
> ...

cd ..
```

### Analysis Notebook

To investigate the model's behavior (e.g., to compute the win percentage for all legal moves), start a notebook server and then open `src/searchless_chess.ipynb` in your browser:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
